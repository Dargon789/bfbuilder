** Features

- syntax highlighting
- automatic indentation
- interactive debugger
- abbrev for repetition

** Installation

Load "bfbuilder.el" and setup ~auto-mode-alist~

: (require 'bfbuilder)
: (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.bf$" . bfbuilder-mode))

then ~bfbuilder-mode~ is activated when opening ".bf" files.

** Keybindings

~TAB~ expands the last abbrev if exists, or indent current line
otherwise. Abbrev is something like ~+10~, or ~(+-)3~ and it expands to
~++++++++++~ or ~+-+-+-~ respectively.

~C-c C-c~ opens debugger. You can execute the program step by step
with following keybindings. Any other key closes the debugger.

- ~j~ :: execute a line
- ~l~ :: execute an instruction
- ~L~ :: execute a group of instructions like ~++++++~
- ~g~ :: reset the debugger state
- ~G~ :: execute forward until it reaches a breakpoint (~@~ by default)

** TODOs

- implement undo (backward execution) feature for the debugger
